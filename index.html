      <p><b>Studying BSc in Computer Science</b></p>
      <p>Technological University of Dublin</p>
      <br>
      <p>Welcome!</p>
      <p>Having studied in the field of Computer Science & Web Development since 2019, I provide a number of services to help grow your business online, something that has become broadly necessary to achieve consistent growth in the modern world of business. From the fundamental building block of a Website, to designing video & graphic advertisements for social media, I can create what you need.</p>
      <p>I started off with a very early interest in Computers that has only seemed to grow as I have gotten older - from getting my first computer in my childhood, to using early spare copies of Photoshop from my uncle as a young teen, to working in the software field in a company as large as Mastercard.</p>
      <p>I offer a number of services related to the Web, Programming and Visual Design:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Web Development</b> - building a website and maintaining it</li>
        <li><b>Logo Design</b> - creating a personalised logo for your brand or business</li>
        <li><b>Business Card</b> - find the perfect way to spread your identity</li>
        <li><b>Photo Editing</b> - have the photo of your family event or wedding displayed with perfection</li>
        <li><b>Social Media Graphics</b> - reach out for help with representing your online identity</li>
        <li><b>Programming</b> - find help to solve your programming problems</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Have a look at my <a href="portfolio.html"><b>Portfolio</b></a>, and if anything strikes your interest, you can reach out to me through my <a href="contact.html"><b>Contact</b></a> page. I hope you have a peaceful day!</p>

      <p><b>Studying BSc in Computer Science</b><br>Technological University of Dublin</p>
      <p>Like many in this field of work, I started off with a very early interest in Computers - getting my first computer at 9, from using early spare copies of Photoshop from my uncle as a young teen, to working in the software field in a large company such as Mastercard, you can say that interest has only grown. <br><br>I specialize in crafting visually stunning websites, with a keen focus on performance and usability - I can help you elevate your brand and inspire your customers. I can help you stand out online, engage your audience, and drive real results. The need for a digital presence in an online world has never been more apparent.</p>

      <h3>Conor Davis</h3>
      <b><p>Studying BSc in Computer Science</p></b><br><p>Technological University of Dublin</p>
      <p>Hello and welcome to my website! Like many in this field of work, I started off with a very early interest in Computers that only seems to grow was I get older - from getting my first computer at 9, to using early spare copies of Photoshop from my uncle as a young teen, to working in the software field in a company as large as Mastercard.<br><br>I offer a number of services related to the web and visual design. I specialize in crafting visually stunning websites, with a keen focus on performance and usability - I can help you elevate your brand and inspire your customers. I can help you stand out online, engage your audience, and drive real results. The need for a digital presence in an online world has never been more apparent. My other services include various forms of graphic design and image editing - alongside the option for potential Programming projects.</p>
      <p>Have a look at my Portfolio, and if anything strikes your interest, you can reach out to me through my Contact page. I hope you have a peaceful day!</p>

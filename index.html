      <h2>Conor Davis</h2>
      <p><b>Studying BSc in Computer Science</b></p>
      <p>Technological University of Dublin</p>
      <p>Welcome!</p>
      <p>Having studied in the field of Computer Science & Web Development since 2019, I can provide you with a number of options to help grow your business through the online space.</p>
      <p>I started off with a very early interest in Computers that has only seemed to grow as I have gotten older - from getting my first computer in my childhood, to using early spare copies of Photoshop from my uncle as a young teen, to working in the software field in a company as large as Mastercard.</p>
      <p>I offer a number of services related to the Web, Programming and Visual Design:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Web Development - building a website and maintaining it</li>
        <li>Logo Design - creating a personalised logo for your brand or business</li>
        <li>Business Card - find the perfect way to spread your identity</li>
        <li>Photo Editing - have the photo of your family event or wedding displayed with perfection</li>
        <li>Social Media Graphics - reach out for help with representing your online identity</li>
        <li>Programming - find help to solve your programming problems</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Have a look at my <a href="portfolio.html"><b>Portfolio</b></a>, and if anything strikes your interest, you can reach out to me through my <a href="contact.html"><b>Contact</b></a> page. I hope you have a peaceful day!</p>
